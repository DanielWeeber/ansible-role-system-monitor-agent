System Monitor Agent
====================

Installs check-mk system monitoring agent so a system can be externally monitored.

Currently this defaults to installing a bundled version of check-mk-agent version 1.26 to be compatible with OMD 1.30 used by the OME.
The current version of check-mk-agent in EPEL is 1.28, which is incompatible.

See [Consol Labs OMD 1.30](https://labs.consol.de/nagios/omd-repository/index.html).
